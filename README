This is a library to perform Blowfish encryption on DCPU-16.  The Blowfish
algorithm is slow to initialize, but fast to encrypt and decrypt compared to
other algorithms.  2084 words of storage are statically allocated to hold the
key schedule, which is expanded from the 128-bit key on initialization.

The Blowfish algorithm is a creation of Bruce Schneier, and is described here:
